## A Brief History

* undergraduate degree in engineering (communications, speciality in applied math)
* Masters in applied math (signal processing) 
* PhD in statistics (statistical signal processing and time series analysis)
* NSERC Canadian Government Laboratories Visiting Fellow (postdoc, Health Canada)
* Trent University, 2016-present

## A Brief History

* started working on signal processing in communications
* did a pair of NSERC USRAs (summers of 2004 and 2005)
* decided I liked this stuff $\Rightarrow$ Masters
* just kept going ...
* ended up in applied statistics
